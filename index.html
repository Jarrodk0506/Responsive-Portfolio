         <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
            My name is Jarrod Krasnoff. I'm an aspiring web developer. I was born and raised in Florida and worked in 
            the timeshare industy for many years. I was always drawn towards tech and so I decided to make my
            career choice in the tech industry. I've been attending UCF coding bootcamp and am currently learning
            Full-stack development.
            </p>
        <br>

            <p>
                I attended a class at Valencia College in C++. I learned a little bit but had a very difficult
                semester with the teacher becoming ill half way through the course. I'd like to look into many
                more languages in the future to broaden my talent.
            </p>
        <br>

            <p>
            I'm currently looking for entry level employment to begin my experience in the development field. I am 
            interested in coding robotics, Video games, and am also interested in learning graphic design. Now that 
            I've found the career field I love I'm excited to learn as much as I possibly can about everything.
            </p>
